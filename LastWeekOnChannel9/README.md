Last Week on Channel 9 Post Creation Utility
====

This is a quick and dirty utility that I use to help me create the weekly Last Week on Channel 9 posts, trying to make it paste, paste, paste, click, click easy to create the posts.

It includes Channel 9 specific classes that drive the two column layout.
